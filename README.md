// context
team 6 members: Jap, Val, Honey, Bill, Francis
Team 6 intends to design an application which serves to help users to find their locations, nearby places, activities based on displayed weather conditions. 

// Project Description
The travelDog application developing in progress intends to offer integrated weather and surrounding activity recommendation services based on actual user or user device location, also userâ€™s preferred destination location. 

// User Story
Group of users tend to find an application which offers an automated recommendation and hourly weather services so that they can plan, predict, monitor and execute a family plan during weekends based on weather, location and other useful parameters. 

//Your project should fulfill the following requirements: 
Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. 
Be deployed to GitHub Pages. Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input). 
Use at least two server-side APIs. 
Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals). 
Use client-side storage to store persistent data. 
Be responsive. Have a polished UI. Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.). 
Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application). 
Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

#log 3 - google map & weather api
francis: i had to push to main few times in demo2 repo, since google api requires url for restricted api connections. The version pushed to main is based on Val's front end, also the completed weather and activities recommendation from Honey. Jap completed the content. 

Honey: completed weather api meeting minimum features, including weather based on city location, displaying 5 day forecast. Also developed activity recommendations based on weather outcomes.
